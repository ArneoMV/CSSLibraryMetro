# Project Title

Scss Library - Metro

## Getting Started

Metro is a SCSS library. With the help of its class we can easily create a website or application.

I started working on this project as part of my final work at the Technical Polytechnic in Zagreb.

### Installing

You can use the library by inserting a CSS folder within your project. If you have SASS installed on your computer, you can insert the SCSS folder within your project and edit it according to your needs.
