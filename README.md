# Project Title

CSS Library - Metro

## Getting Started

Metro is a CSS library. With the help of its components you can easily create a responsive website.

I started working on this project as part of my final work at the Zagreb University of applied sciences.

### Installing

You can use the library by inserting a CSS folder within your project. If you have SASS installed on your computer, you can insert the SCSS folder within your project and edit new components and styles according to your needs.

## Built With

* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS.
* [Javascript](https://devdocs.io/javascript/) - JavaScript is a scripting programming language that is executed in the user's web browser.
