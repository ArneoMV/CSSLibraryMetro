    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Metro is a CSS  library that you can use for your own purposes to make it easy to create a website or application. 
    Provides functionality that speeds up the frontend development process when creating an application. 
    That way, developers don't have to write style code from scratch every time they build applications.
    A set of small, compatible SCSS modules that you can use in any web project.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The difference between a CSS librery CSS and a CSS framework is in the control you have over the project. In the library, you have control. 
        This means you control when a library needs to perform a specific function, and the rest of the code is library independent. 
        In the case of frames, control is inventoried. The control flow is in the frame and you can adjust it to fit your needs. 
        Time saving and consistent structure are the biggest benefits of using a CSS workspace.</p>

    <ul>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <li>Offers three ways to create layouts: CSS grid, columns and CSS flex</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <li>The components found here are global components that affect our overall appearance.</li>
        <li> We influenced: typography, colors, pictures, tables and input elements</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Navigation menu's</h3>
        <li>Four types of navigation menus have been created that we can use: side menu, top menu, breadcrumb, scrollspy menu and float</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <li>Components are elements that we can use in a project as needed.</li>
        <li>List of all components: hamburger icon's, collapse, form's, card's, button's, modal, progress bar, pagination, carousel</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Utilities</h3>
        <li>Indicates classes that are added to tag elements. The classes that can be attached to a tag element are: visability, shadow's, border's</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    
    <p>The library saves time so developers can focus on the specific problem of the application rather than styling the layout. 
    The main advantage is the ability to reuse the code. The predefined structure provided by the framework helps maintain consistency across applications and its various components. 
    Developers do not need to require specifications for every single design element they will get from a designer.
    They have a consistent design scheme that is built into the frame and, if necessary, can tailor components to their needs. 
    Designers can use frames to reduce the time they spend designing basic components. Instead, they can focus on other design priorities.</p>
